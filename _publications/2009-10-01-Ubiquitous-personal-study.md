The information resources on the Web are diversified, the amount of which is increasing rapidly. Demands for selecting useful information from the Internet, managing personal contents, and sharing contents under control have risen. In this study, we propose the Ubiquitous Personal Study, a framework of personalized virtual study to support accessing, managing, organizing, sharing and recommending information. In this paper, we focus on discussing the framework, and design and implementation issues on how to implement it with Web 2.0 mash-up technology and Open Source Software.
